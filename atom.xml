We felt our version of a file uploader could have a real impact if we made it more widely available. So, just like Transloadit had done before with <a href="https://tus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tus</a>, we decided to make Uppy an open source solution &#x2014; free for anyone to use and hack on. Transloadit support became an optional plugin.</p><p>Three years, <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/stargazers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">16.000 stargazers</a>, getting featured on <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/the-smashing-newsletter/smashing-newsletter-issue-197/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/JavaScriptDaily/status/950348390268919809" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JavaScript Daily</a>, <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy-io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product Hunt</a>, and <a href="https://survivejs.com/blog/uppy-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SurviveJS</a>, and a thriving community later &#x2014; and we could not be happier to finally launch Uppy 1.0!</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Why-build-Uppy-in-the-first-place"><a href="#Why-build-Uppy-in-the-first-place" class="headerlink" title="Why build Uppy in the first place?"></a>Why build Uppy in the first place?</h2><p>We occasionally get asked why we would even need anything beyond <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;</code>. Why bring JS into this at all? The truth is, for many cases, <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;</code> is fine.</p><p>Sometimes, however, you might like to add a drag-and-drop surface with file previews or upload progress reporting that works well across browsers. Webcam support could be useful. Other than that, picking files directly from your Instagram and Dropbox &#x2014; without first passing through your mobile phone &#x2014; can save a lot of bandwidth and battery life (uploads with Uppy and Companion happen server-to-server). In all those cases, you&#x2019;ll need something more than a simple <code>&lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;</code> tag.</p><center><iframe style="border: none;" src="https://cards.producthunt.com/cards/posts/152565?v=1" width="598" height="405" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></center><p>Then there&#x2019;s also the issue of large files, where resumability is essential. It&#x2019;s basically unacceptable in this day and age to still have to restart your upload from scratch, just because your WiFi had a hiccup. That&#x2019;s why Uppy uses Tus, the open protocol for resumable file uploading.</p><p>All these things significantly improve the user experience to the point where more files actually make it to your platform, and less users rage-quit and close the tab. These things become important when uploading is a central aspect of your website or app. Uppy can also be deployed with nothing but a JS tag, using an existing <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> for fallback (to support IE6! <span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png?v8">&#x1F604;</span>), and your Apache/Nginx server.</p><h2 id="Building-a-team-to-create-Uppy"><a href="#Building-a-team-to-create-Uppy" class="headerlink" title="Building a team to create Uppy"></a>Building a team to create Uppy</h2><p>The Uppy team first consisted of <a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myself</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hedgerh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harry</a>. Since I moved to New York for a while, with most of the team based in Europe, we got used to having some very early (or late) calls with significant time differences.</p><p>I was mostly working on the frontend and building what is known today as the <a href="/examples/dashboard/">Dashboard</a> &#x2014; the fully-featured and most commonly used Uppy plugin. Harry took on the first version of what was then called Uppy Server (now Companion) &#x2014; responsible for picking files from Google Drive, Instagram, remote Urls, etc.</p><p>In 2016, the Transloadit team had a meetup in Amsterdam, where I ended up being <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/arturi/status/701394760796229632" target="_blank" rel="noopener">present</a> in a most unusual way (in the center):</p><p><img src="/images/blog/1.0/amsterdam-team-meetup.jpg"></p><p>Later that year, <a href="https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ife</a> joined the Uppy team as well and took over all Companion work.</p><p>Building all of the intended Uppy features properly took a lot of time. So, two years after landing the project at Transloadit, I was <a href="https://transloadit.com/jobs/2017-02-open-source-frontend-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">writing a job ad post myself</a> as Uppy was starting to take on serious proportions. That&#x2019;s where <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ren&#xE9;e</a> joined the team (funny story &#x2014; we met through collaborating on GitHub on Choo and Yo-Yo libraries) to help us with Uppy React components, Redux integration, the Golden Retriever plugin and many more cool features.</p><p>Around that time, <a href="https://zaytsev.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> also joined in to advise us on the UI design, completing the Uppy team as it still stands today.</p><p>In the summer of 2017, the Transloadit team had another meeting. This time in Berlin, where we worked on the <a href="/docs/golden-retriever/">Golden Retriever</a> plugin that helps recover files after browser crashes. We also played Mario Kart (I lost, despite all the practice!) and dressed up as characters from the game:</p><p><img src="/images/blog/1.0/uppy-team-kong.jpg"></p><p>Read more <a href="https://uppy.io/blog/2017/07/golden-retriever/">about Golden Retriever and that team meetup</a>. Golden Retriever got good press on Reddit and Hacker News because it goes above and beyond to make things absurdly reliable. In the demo video, you see us <code>kill -9</code> our browser, restart, and the upload just picks right up where it left off. A first!</p><h2 id="Challenge-accepted-only-30-days-to-liftoff"><a href="#Challenge-accepted-only-30-days-to-liftoff" class="headerlink" title="Challenge accepted: only 30 days to liftoff"></a>Challenge accepted: only 30 days to liftoff</h2><p>We had been postponing the 1.0 release for quite some time. There&#x2019;s always just one more feature you&#x2019;d like to add or another bug you want to fix, before calling something ready for a 1.0 release. Truth be told, Uppy has been <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy#used-by" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used in production</a> for a while already, and even though we iterate and change things frequently, the API had mostly stabilized.</p><p>So, about a month ago, we decided to pull the trigger and <a href="https://uppy.io/blog/2019/03/liftoff-01/">announced an Uppy Month</a> within Transloadit. This meant that all team members, including those not working primarily on Uppy &#x2014; the Tus core team, our SDK teams, as well as our infra and API engineers, designers, content writers, and the founders themselves &#x2014; all chipped in and did their part to ensure liftoff in thirty days. We also asked <a href="http://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia</a> to join us for the month to lend a hand with frontend work. Every week, we had a call where we looked at the Uppy 1.0 project board and talked about our progress:</p><p><img src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/15-dashboard.png"></p><p>Here are some highlights of what we&#x2019;ve managed to deliver during one month of Everything Uppy:</p><ul><li>A new Uppy website design.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1443" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Localization support and language packs</a> for Russian, German, Dutch and French (with more coming from the community). <a href="https://github.com/kvz" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kevin</a> and I wrote a script that loops through all Uppy plugins in the repo and generates one canonical <code>en_US</code> that can be used as a basis for other translations. The script even checks for missing strings accross all translations, so you know which ones to update.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1440" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drag and Drop in the Dashboard</a>, being an important part of Uppy, has been significantly improved with support for pasting files and links from both the browser and the device. So you can now, say, drag a link or an image from a different tab to Uppy!</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Basic React Native support (Beta)</a>: Uppy runs in a React Native environment, we have an example with resumable uploads via tus, and <code>@uppy/react-native</code> Expo-component support for picking images, videos, documents, and files from remote URLs with the help of Companion.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1442" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design facelift</a>: the Dashboard UI has been significantly improved in the past days: new icons have been added, as well as typography polishing, better color organization, enlarged clickable areas, and more.</li><li>Many accessibility issues uncovered.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1450" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Robodog gained support for an inline Dashboard</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1405" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The documentation structure has been reworked</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Transloadit Assemblies can now be properly canceled</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upload progress is reported more accurately with XHR-upload and Companion</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1376" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upload progress is improved in general</a>.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1392" target="_blank" rel="noopener">npm scripts have been refactored</a> &#x2014; yes, that&#x2019;s important!</li><li>And craziest of all: our content team has been on a roll and <a href="https://uppy.io/blog/2019/03/liftoff-01/">released a post <em>every day</em></a> for the past thirty days to keep you updated on our day-to-day progress.</li></ul><h2 id="Which-features-made-it-into-1-0-And-which-didn&#x2019;t-yet"><a href="#Which-features-made-it-into-1-0-And-which-didn&#x2019;t-yet" class="headerlink" title="Which features made it into 1.0? And which didn&#x2019;t (yet)?"></a>Which features made it into 1.0? And which didn&#x2019;t (yet)?</h2><p>Uppy 1.0 feature list:</p><ul><li>Sleek user interface</li><li>Lightweight and easy on dependencies</li><li>A small core with modular architecture: everything is a plugin</li><li>Uses modern JavaScript with transpiled ES5 versions available in <code>lib</code>, and minified versions for direct use by browsers in <code>dist</code></li><li>Usable as a bundle straight from a CDN, as well as a module to import</li><li>Resumable file uploads via the open Tus standard</li><li>Direct uploads to S3</li><li>Webcam support</li><li>Picking files from Dropbox, Google Drive and Instagram, while letting servers do the heavy lifting via Companion</li><li>Robust: retries for all-the-things</li><li>Built with accessibility in mind (not perfect yet, but we constantly improve)</li><li>File recovery (after a browser crash or accidental navigation) via Golden Retriever</li><li>Locale support: easily switch languages or supply your own copy</li><li>Compatible with React (React Native in beta)</li><li>Works great on mobile</li><li>Works great with Transloadit, works great without</li></ul><p>We also left two features &#x201C;behind&#x201D;:</p><blockquote><p>Offering sugared shortcuts for novice users (presets)</p></blockquote><p>We felt that Uppy is straightforward enough to use, and presets could end up making this less clear. Robodog does offer less &#x201C;boilerplatey&#x201D; integrations, but this was done as a wrapper instead of a preset.</p><blockquote><p>Themable UI with a beautiful default</p></blockquote><p>Instead of going for <code>{ theme: &apos;dark&apos; }</code>, we only offer theming via CSS. For instance, it&#x2019;s feasible to utilize the <code>prefers-color-scheme</code> media query for that.</p><p>Lastly, our &#x201C;picking files from remote sources&#x201D; feature isn&#x2019;t quite as full fledged as we maybe would have liked, since support for Google Photos, Box or Facebook is currently not included. We hope these are things that the community can help with.</p><h2 id="What&#x2019;s-next-for-Uppy"><a href="#What&#x2019;s-next-for-Uppy" class="headerlink" title="What&#x2019;s next for Uppy?"></a>What&#x2019;s next for Uppy?</h2><p>Does this mean Uppy is perfect? Nope!</p><p>There are still quite a lot of <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues</a> and items in our backlog, and we are already <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning Uppy 1.1</a>. We also want to maybe release a WordPress plugin, add image cropping, and much more, but we are releasing 1.0 today because it contains virtually all of the features that we set out to implement. These features have all been documented and we don&#x2019;t expect their APIs to change. If, at some point, they do need to change, we will have to handle that with care. For instance, by shipping a 2.0 version and making all the noise that comes with it.</p><p>Uppy has already seen serious usage by a seriously large community and by various serious enterprises. So, with 1.0, we&#x2019;re now also signaling to you: Hey, we take this seriously and we won&#x2019;t be swapping things out from under your app, just like that. Also, if you don&#x2019;t yet have Uppy powering your file uploads, now is the best time to give it a shot!</p><p>We hope your users will be as delighted by Uppy 1.0 as we have been designing and building it. Seeing your support and contributions while doing so, made all the difference. Thank you so much!

      &lt;p&gt;Today, after three years of development, we are launching version 1.0 of Uppy, our file uploader for web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, we’re looking for polished, well tested, carefully crafted products that are delightful to work with and use. So for this job it’s not only important that you know JavaScript, but also how to make things look stunning and work well for end users.&lt;/p&gt;

He also implemented support for a jQuery SDK parameter that didn&#x2019;t work in Robodog.form yet, and smashed out the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1475" target="_blank" rel="noopener">German Locale Pack</a>!</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/kiloreux" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Abdel</a> <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1481" target="_blank" rel="noopener">translated</a> Uppy to French. <img src="https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/20061212?s=460&amp;v=4" width="16" align="absmiddle"></p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artur</a> <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1468" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documented</a> the Thumbnail Generator plugin and made a few more hardcoded English strings translatable via Locale Packs.

To save time for actually working on these tasks, instead of typing, let me share a screenshot of what we agreed upon:</p><center><a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-day30-board.png"><img src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-day30-board.png"></a><br><br></center><p>It&#x2019;s gonna be a close call. <a href="https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ife</a>, especially, has a lot on his plate with that &#x201C;<a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/issues/146" target="_blank" rel="noopener">600MB issue</a>&#x201C; still untackled, but we did get <a href="https://github.com/Acconut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marius</a> on board with the way we want to solve it, so now it&#x2019;s full steam ahead.</p><p>Before I&#x2019;m going back to the team and help out where I can, I&#x2019;d like to thank you for reading along with us for these past thirty days.

It quickly became clear that in order to set ourselves up for success, we needed to plan ahead and establish some basic rules. Strict deadlines, for instance, helped out a lot: the first iteration needed to be in before lunch, with a second one done shortly after lunch. Otherwise, folks would end up working overtime or even on the next day, when it was already time for the next post. </p><p>Luckily, we had our content team to take ownership of the whole process and keep these distractions away from the Uppy core team as much as possible. In the end, we really enjoyed sharing our development process with the world and giving interested developers a better understanding of what we&#x2019;re trying to accomplish, and how.</p><p>We hope to see you tomorrow again for our 1.0 launch, which will be accompanied by a meaty release post! Make sure to follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/uppy_io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter</a> or via our <a href="https://uppy.io/atom.xml">RSS feed</a> if you don&#x2019;t want to miss it!</p><!-- <center><img width="400" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/11syU6ZZ6PsGRO/giphy.gif"><br/><br/></center> --><script>        document.querySelectorAll('.github-emoji')          .forEach(el => {            if (!el.dataset.src) { return; }            const img = document.createElement('img');            img.style = 'display:none !important;';            img.src = el.dataset.src;            img.addEventListener('error', () => {              img.remove();              el.style.color = 'inherit';              el.style.backgroundImage = 'none';              el.style.background = 'none';            });            img.addEventListener('load', () => {              img.remove();            });            document.body.appendChild(img);          });      </script>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;And then there were none! Zero days left in our thirty-day blog post challenge. I can’t believe this is already the final day of our push to get Uppy to 1.0. There’s still a bunch of things that we’d like to finish before shipping, so let’s dive right in.&lt;/p&gt;

We think just about everything is working, so now it&#x2019;s time for someone to try and break it all! <span class="github-emoji" style="color: transparent;background:no-repeat url(https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f528.png?v8) center/contain" data-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f528.png?v8">&#x1F528;</span> Slight warning: we&#x2019;re in the process of making some big behind-the-scenes changes, so there may be some issues that crop up on our webpage. </p></li><li><p>Uppy 0.30.5 will be released by <a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artur</a> today. One of the main changes here is our name change from the <code>serverUrl</code> property to <code>companionUrl</code>. A simple check is being added and we will notify users that it has been depreceated, so they have ample time to apply the change to their own code.</p></li><li><p>An alpha version of <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/988" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React Native support</a> was merged into our Uppy master branch on Github. We&#x2019;re confident that our initial release will be useful for those who need a basic implementation. Of course, our React Native development will continue as we go forth, so stay tuned for that. </p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ife</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Acconut" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marius</a> continue their work on large-file issues related to React Native and tus-js-client. They are considering to add a tus option to allow React Native developers to pass their own custom file picker module. This would add some flexibility for developers and prevent us from bloating tus-js-client.</p></li><li><p>Error reporting for the Transloadit plugin will be worked on by <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ren&#xE9;e</a>. This will ensure users are notified of various issues while utilizing the API, such as connection issues.</p></li></ul><p>Thus ends Day 24.

      &lt;p&gt;Only six days remain in our ‘30 Days to Liftoff’ blog post challenge toward &lt;strong&gt;releasing Uppy 1.0 on April 25&lt;/strong&gt;. Technically, it’s even less than that, seeing as Easter is coming up and we won’t be doing much work during the holidays. So, with just three working days left, we are starting to feel the heat. :fire: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we’re also very close to reaching all of our release goals. Let’s take a look at where we are now!&lt;/p&gt;

We were able to move a few tasks to the <em>Done</em> lane and got some new tasks <em>In Progress</em>. One of the features we&#x2019;re ready to start working on - which I am particularly interested in - is language pack support. Uppy 1.0 might be coming out in your local language! While we only have the capacity within our team to take care of a select few languages (English, French, Russian, Ukrainian, German, and Dutch) we will support as many as possible and hope that the community will add many more. </p><p>Here is a view of what our Asana board looks like this week:</p><center><br><img src="/images/blog/30daystoliftoff/2019-04-09-asana-board.png"><br></center><h2 id="Done"><a href="#Done" class="headerlink" title="Done"></a>Done</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia</a> investigated an <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1400#issuecomment-481039845" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issue</a> concerning a bug in Webkit browsers that resulted in the window blinking frequently.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/samuelayo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samuel</a> added another <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/1389" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example</a> for using Uppy with XHR uploads to a PHP backend.</p></li></ul><h2 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ren&#xE9;e</a> is working on the Robodog Dashboard, so that it can also be depicted right inside the webpage, instead of showing as a modal popup window.</p></li><li><p>Evgenia is focused on improving accessibility together with <a href="https://github.com/nqst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a>, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this area.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/arturi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Artur</a> is currently working on a React Native example UI.

In our local tests, this means we can now successfully pick different files, have their uploads resume where they left off, select a remote file via Companion (for now, only picking from URL is supported) and see the progress reported by it. </p><p>There is a basic UI, most of which is encapsulated in the example that we&#x2019;ll publish on our website. We&#x2019;re refraining from building too much UI in our React Native module, as we assume that developers will want to have full control and style everything close to their app. We figured they would care most about seeing a good example and having access to core functionality, such as making mobile uploads more reliable and less draining on batteries and data plans. </p><p>While there are still things to be implemented, such as picking files from Instagram, we now know that we have all the Lego bricks required and that they are doing what they&#x2019;re supposed to. Now, it&#x2019;s just a matter of fleshing out those integrations, but we&#x2019;ll have to see whether we can get to that before 1.0. We&#x2019;re already happy about having a fixed idea about the API and a basic working example as our deliverables!</p><h2 id="In-Progress"><a href="#In-Progress" class="headerlink" title="In Progress"></a>In Progress</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://github.com/nqst" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alex</a> is working on improving the Uppy design (in the code) in his <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/compare/master...nqst:design-facelift" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>design-facelift</code> branch</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://github.com/lakesare" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evgenia</a> is working on improving accessibility together with Alex, who found many issues that we still need to fix in this area.</p></li><li><p>Now that the bare essentials of React Native work, Ife is making sure our local work finds a proper place in the tus-js-client (such as React-Native-compatible fingerprinting) while Artur hopes to find the time to tick off a few design goals to make for a better experience testdriving our example. Things like icons for files that are not images and a <em>Close</em> button for the select file screen.</p></li><li><p>The whole team will again do a call this afternoon to reassess our roadmap and see where all we stand. Some new tasks were added on <a href="/blog/2019/04/liftoff-11/">Friday</a>, so we&#x2019;ll also have to see about getting those into gear.</p></li></ul><p>That&#x2019;s it for Day 14.
